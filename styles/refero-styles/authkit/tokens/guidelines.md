# Guidelines

### Do
- Use 999px radius for all interactive elements (buttons, social-login buttons, tag toggles); reserve 16px radius exclusively for cards and modals, 6px for badges and inputs, and 9999px for circular icon containers.
- Build elevation from inset frost highlights + soft outer halos rather than conventional drop-shadows: pair inset rgba(216,236,248,0.2) 1px top edge with a 24-48px inset glow and a dark cool drop.
- Use Void Violet (#663af3) exclusively for the auth-form Continue/submit CTA - never as a decorative accent or non-auth button background.
- Set headline text in aeonikPro weight 500 at 44-48px with the Skywash vertical gradient (#d8ecf8 #98c0ef); body and UI in Untitled Sans 400-500.
- Place all-caps eyebrow labels (dotDigital, 15px, 0.10em tracking, #c7d3ea) centered and flanked by fading horizontal lines at rgba(186,215,247,0.12) to mark every section opening.
- Use rgba(186,215,247,0.12) as the universal hairline border - never solid strokes; the frosted-inset edge is the system's border language.
- Set section gaps at 120px and card padding at 24px; rhythm should feel cathedral-like rather than dense SaaS.
- Render text in the Ice Highlight Frost Glow Moon Mist Fog Veil progression (#d8ecf8 #d1e4fa #c7d3ea #9da7ba) for heading body muted body helper copy.
- Use the conic-gradient spotlight halo (rgba(124,145,182,0.5) at center, fading outward) at the top of every full-bleed hero to anchor the composition.

### Don't
- Do not introduce additional chromatic accents - the palette is monochromatic with one violet CTA; any extra hue breaks the system.
- Do not use solid colored borders; replace them with 1px inset rgba(186,215,247,0.12) strokes to preserve the glass aesthetic.
- Do not use bold weights (600+) on aeonikPro display headings - the wordmark's authority comes from weight 500 at large size, not volume.
- Do not apply conventional drop-shadows; the system reads elevation through inset glow + dark halo.
- Do not mix radius families on the same component type - every button is pill, every card is 16px, every badge is 6px.
- Do not place white (#ffffff) on background tints brighter than rgba(186,214,247,0.12) - the contrast floor collapses.
- Do not use the Skywash gradient on body text or buttons; reserve it for the display wordmark and the largest headings only.
- Do not introduce light-theme colors into core tokens even though the product supports light mode; the marketing site is dark-first, and light-mode demos are a product feature, not a design-system palette.

## Accessibility Notes

- Verify contrast for every text and action pairing.
- Preserve keyboard focus states even if the source visual language is quiet.
- Keep target sizes comfortable on mobile and desktop.
